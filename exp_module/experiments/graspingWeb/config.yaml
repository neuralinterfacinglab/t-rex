# Command that the script will call.
# if multiple commands must be called (execute multiple scripts, set environment variables) we suggest to create another script that handles this process (.bat, .sh, etc.).

# Note: 
#   remember to use backslash (\) [on windows] when setting paths, i.e.:
#       full path:      E:\Projects\trex\exp_module\experiments\you_exp_folder\your_exp_file.ext
#       relative path:  .\exp_module\experiments\you_exp_folder\your_exp_file.ext
#   and slash (/) [on Linux] when setting paths, i.e.:
#       full path:      /home/user/Documents/trex/exp_module/experiments/you_exp_folder/your_exp_file.ext
#       relative path:  ./exp_module/experiments/you_exp_folder/your_exp_file.ext
